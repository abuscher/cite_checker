  The Execution of the Restitution Fine Must Be Stayed
 </i>
</h4>
<p>
</p>
<p>
 California law provides for two types of restitution: direct restitution to the victim (Pen. Code, § 1202.4, subd. (f)), which is based on a direct victim's loss, and a restitution fine (Pen. Code, § 1202.4, subd. (b)), which is not. Payment of direct victim restitution goes directly to victims and compensates them for economic losses they have suffered because of the defendant's crime. (
 <a target="_blank" href="https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=13825503652650525493&amp;q=30+Cal.+App.+5th+1157&amp;hl=en&amp;as_sdt=2006">

 </a>
 .) Direct victim restitution was not ordered and is not at issue in this case.
</p>
<p>
 Here, the trial court imposed a restitution fine on Dueñas. Restitution fines are set at the discretion of the court in an amount commensurate with the seriousness of the offense and within a range set by statute. (Pen. Code, § 1202.4, subd. (b).) At all times relevant to this matter, the minimum restitution fine for a misdemeanor was $150 and the maximum restitution fine was $1000. (

 ) Restitution fines are not paid to the victim of the crime. Instead, they are paid into a statewide victim compensation fund. (Pen. Code, § 1202.4, subd. (e).)

 Unlike the assessments discussed above, the restitution fine is intended to be, and is recognized as, additional punishment for a crime. (

v.
VELIA DUEÑAS, Defendant and Appellant. (page *1161)</a></h4>The family of four receives $350 per month in California Work Opportunity and Responsibility to Kids cash benefits and $649 per month in CalFresh food stamps benefits. Dueñas uses all the money she receives to take care of the children, but she cannot afford basic necessities for her family. She has no bank account and no credit card. She owns only her clothing and a mobile phone, and her mobile phone service is frequently disconnected because she cannot afford the $40 per month payment.
<p>
 The family has no home of their own; they alternate between staying at Dueñas's mother's home and the home of her mother-in-law. The electricity was cut off to her mother-in-law's home because the family could not afford to pay the bill.
</p>
<p>
</p>
<h4>
 A.
 <i>
  Prior Legal Proceedings
 </i>
</h4>
<p>
</p>
<p>
 When Dueñas was a teenager, she received three juvenile citations. She could not afford to pay the $1,088 she was assessed for these citations. Because she could not pay her debt, her driver's license was suspended. Dueñas was unable to have her driver's license reinstated because she could not afford the fees, and she did not qualify for the state amnesty program.
</p>
<p>
 Over the next several years, Dueñas suffered three misdemeanor convictions for driving with a suspended license and one conviction for failing to appear on a driving without a license case. In these cases, Dueñas was offered the ostensible choice of paying a fine or serving jail time in lieu of payment. Each time, she could not afford the fees, so she served time in jail—a total of 51 days across four cases. Additionally, she was sentenced to 90 days in jail for driving with a suspended license. In total, Dueñas was sentenced to 141 days in jail for driving with a driver's license that had been suspended because she had been unable to pay her juvenile citations.
</p>
<p>
 Even after serving her jail time, Dueñas remained liable for court fees associated with each misdemeanor conviction. In one case, she was also ordered to pay attorney fees. She was unable to pay those amounts, and they were sent to collections. Dueñas receives letters from collection agencies, but she has no way to pay off her debt.
</p>
<p>
</p>
<h4>

 <i>
  Present Proceedings
 </i>
</h4>
<p>
</p>
<p>
 On July 13, 2015, Dueñas pleaded no contest to another misdemeanor charge of driving with a suspended license (Veh. Code, § 14601.1, subd. (a)) based on a plea agreement that conditioned the consequences for the conviction on whether she obtained a valid driver's license by the time of the sentencing hearing. If Dueñas returned to court on the date of sentencing

'>THE PEOPLE, Plaintiff and Respondent,
v.
VELIA DUEÑAS, Defendant and Appellant. (page *1163)</a></h4>that Dueñas was homeless, "it might be simpler to do it here in court" rather than require her to see the financial evaluator. The court said that it did not make sense for it to "sort through the documents myself" and that she should "avail herself of the expertise of the financial evaluator." The court offered some flexibility in setting the date of the hearing but cautioned, "I don't want to get into the habit of having litigants determine what day they want to come back." The court also stated its belief, which was inaccurate, that if Dueñas were to be unable to appear for the hearing, the fees and fines would not be sent to collections or transformed into a civil judgment.
<p>
 At the March 17, 2016 ability to pay hearing, the court reviewed Dueñas's uncontested declaration concerning her financial circumstances, determined that she lacked the ability to pay the previously ordered attorney fees, and waived them on the basis of her indigence. The court concluded that the $30 court facilities assessment under Government Code section 70373 and $40 court operations assessment under Penal Code section 1465.8 were both mandatory regardless of Dueñas's inability to pay them. With respect to the $150 restitution fine, the court found that Dueñas had not shown the "compelling and extraordinary reasons" required by statute (Pen. Code, § 1202.4, subd. (c)) to justify waiving this fine. The court rejected Dueñas's constitutional arguments that due process and equal protection required the court to consider her ability to pay these fines and assessments, and ordered her to pay $220 by February 21, 2019. The trial court told Dueñas that, "[i]f in the end you're not able to pay, you won't be punished for it. Those [sums] will go to collections without any further order from this court."
</p>
<p>
 The superior court appellate division affirmed the trial court's order. We granted Dueñas's petition to transfer the case to the Court of Appeal. (Cal. Rules of Court, rule 8.1002.)

 "Raising money for government through law enforcement whatever the source—parking tickets, police-issued citations, court-imposed fees, bills for court appointed attorneys, punitive fines, incarceration charges, supervision fees, and more—can lay a debt trap for the poor. When a minor offense produces a debt, that debt, along with the attendant court appearances, can lead to loss of employment or shelter, compounding interest, yet more legal action, and an ever-expanding financial burden—a cycle as predictable and counterproductive as it is intractable."

VELIA DUEÑAS, Defendant and Appellant. (page *1171)</a></h4>court that dismissal of the charges and relief from the penalties of the offense is in the interest of justice. (Pen. Code, § 1203.4, subd. (a)(1).)
<p>
 In this statutory scheme, therefore, the wealthy defendant is offered an ultimate outcome that the indigent one will never be able to obtain—the successful completion of all the terms of probation and the resultant absolute right to relief from the conviction, charges, penalties, and disabilities of the offense. At best, indigent defendants who cannot pay their restitution fine can try to persuade a trial court to exercise its discretion to grant them relief, despite their failure to comply with all terms of probation; at worst, they are deprived of relief, with all the collateral consequences that the legislation was designed to avoid. This result arises solely and exclusively from their poverty.
</p>
<p>
 The statutory scheme thus results in a limitation of rights to those who are unable to pay. The heart of the due process inquiry is whether it is "fundamentally unfair" to use the criminal justice system to impose punitive burdens on probationers who have "made all reasonable efforts to pay the fine or restitution, and yet cannot do so through no fault of [their] own...." (
 <a target="_blank" href="https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=12397530380886309714&amp;q=30+Cal.+App.+5th+1157&amp;hl=en&amp;as_sdt=2006">

<p>
 The People minimize the difference between expungement as of right and upon discretion in the interest of justice, asserting that Dueñas "fails to explain why this discretionary relief would be denied to those who demonstrate an inability to pay in their expungement applications." But given that restitution is a condition of probation, and the restitution statute instructs the trial court that a defendant's inability to pay is an illegitimate consideration in imposing the minimum restitution fine, it is not at all clear that a trial court would treat inability to pay as a legitimate consideration in determining

<p>
 This distinction, based on the reasons for nonpayment, is of critical importance here. If the probationer has willfully refused to pay the fine or restitution when he has the means to pay, the State is perfectly justified in using imprisonment as a sanction to enforce collection. See ALI, Model Penal Code § 302.2(1) (Prop. Off. Draft 1962). Similarly, a probationer's failure to make sufficient bona fide efforts to seek employment or borrow money in order to pay the fine or restitution may reflect an insufficient concern for paying the debt he owes to society for his crime. In such a situation, the State is likewise justified in revoking probation and using imprisonment as an appropriate penalty for the offense. But if the probationer has made all reasonable efforts to pay the fine or restitution, and yet cannot do so through no fault of his own,

 Imposing unpayable fines on indigent defendants is not only unfair, it serves no rational purpose, fails to further the legislative intent, and may be counterproductive. A fine on indigent people "is not imposed to further any penal objective of the State. It is imposed to augment the State's revenues but obviously does not serve that purpose; the defendant cannot pay because he is indigent...." (

  Adams,

 at p. 113.) Yet, although Penal Code section 1202.4 permits the court to waive imposition of a restitution fine if it finds "compelling and extraordinary reasons" why the fine should not be imposed, the statute expressly states that inability to pay the fine does not qualify:
 <sup>
  <a class="gsl_hash" href="#[6]" name="r[6]">

 </sup>
 "A defendant's inability to pay shall not be considered a compelling and extraordinary reason not to impose a restitution fine." (Pen. Code, § 1202.4, subd. (c).) This provision is at odds with the policy articulated in Penal Code section 1203.2, subdivision (a): "Restitution shall be consistent with a person's ability to pay."

</p>
<p>
 As a result of Penal Code section 1202.4, subdivision (c)'s prohibition on considering the defendant's ability to pay the minimum fine, the criminal justice system punishes indigent defendants in a way that it does not punish wealthy defendants. In most cases, a defendant who has successfully fulfilled the conditions of probation for the entire period of probation has an absolute statutory right to have the charges against him or her dismissed. (Pen. Code, § 1203.4, subd. (a)(1).) The defendant must be "released from all penalties and disabilities resulting from the offense of which he or she has been convicted," with the exception of driver's license revocation proceedings. (
 <i>
  Ibid.
 </i>
 ; see Veh. Code, § 13555.) But if a probationer cannot afford the mandatory restitution fine, through no fault of his or her own he or she is categorically barred from earning the right to have his or her charges dropped and to relief from the penalties and disabilities of the offense for which he or she has been on probation, no matter how completely he or she complies with every other condition of his or her probation.

These, in turn, have occasioned new fines, fees, and assessments that she is unable to pay. As the trial court described it, the repeat criminal proceedings have caused her financial obligations to "snowball."

<p>
 Dueñas argues that laws imposing fines and fees on people too poor to pay punish the poor for their poverty. These statutes, she asserts, are fundamentally unfair because they use the criminal law, which is centrally concerned with identifying and punishing only blameworthy decisions, to punish the blameless failure to pay by a person who cannot pay because of her poverty. The laws, moreover, are irrational: They raise no money because people who cannot pay do not pay. We conclude that due process of law requires the trial court to conduct an ability to pay hearing and ascertain a defendant's present ability to pay before it imposes court facilities and court operations assessments under Penal Code section 1465.8 and Government Code section 70373. We also hold that although Penal Code section 1202.4 bars consideration of a defendant's ability to pay unless the judge is considering increasing the fee over the statutory minimum, the execution of any restitution fine imposed under this statute must be stayed unless and until the trial court holds an ability to pay hearing and concludes that the defendant has the present ability to pay the restitution fine.

<i>
 Analysis Is Fundamentally Flawed
</i>
<p>
</p>
<p>
 Unlike the majority, I instead would conclude the
 <i>
  Dueñas
 </i>
 decision incorrectly applies California statutes; and in addition, is fundamentally flawed in that general "fairness" grounds of due process and/or equal protection principles do not afford a defendant a preassessment ability-to-pay hearing before a trial court imposes fines and fees on him or her.
</p>
<p>
 First, I believe that in reaching its conclusions,
 <i>
  Dueñas
 </i>
 by judicial fiat inserted language into statutes that did not exist. That is, I note the adjective "present" used by the
 <i>
  Dueñas
 </i>
 court in its ability-to-pay analysis is nowhere to be found in Penal Code sections 1202.4 and 1465.8, or in Government Code section 70373. (See
 <a target="_blank" href="https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=13269025107103154166&amp;q=35+Cal.+App.+5th+1027&amp;hl=en&amp;as_sdt=2006">

 <i>
  present ability
 </i>
 of the defendant to pay all or a portion of the cost thereof" (italics added)].)
</p>
<p>
 Perhaps more egregiously,
 <i>
  Dueñas
 </i>
 in its analysis completely disregarded unambiguous language in subdivision (c) of section 1202.4 stating that inability to pay cannot be considered when only the statutory minimum is imposed, as was the case there. Moreover, by also adding the word "present" to the ability-to-pay analysis with respect to the restitution fine,
 <i>
  Dueñas
 </i>
 ignored section 1202.4, subdivision (d), which says the exact opposite: "Consideration of a defendant's inability to pay may include his or her
 <i>
  future earning capacity.
 </i>
 " (Italics added.) A court lacks the power to rewrite a statute either so as to make it conform to a presumed intention that is not stated, or to ignore a statute's plain and unambiguous language. (See
 <a target="_blank" href="https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=2150543449512920776&amp;q=35+Cal.+App.+5th+1027&amp;hl=en&amp;as_sdt=2006">

</p>
<p>
 I would conclude that, to the extent the
 <i>
  Legislature
 </i>
 provided such a right, which in the instant case it did with respect to the restitution fine (see § 1202.4, subds. (b)(1) &amp; (c)) and the sex offender registration fee (see § 290.3, subd. (a)),

Specifically, that case concluded that due process and equal protection guaranteed an indigent criminal defendant a free transcript of trial proceedings in order to provide that defendant with

to a court of review, where he would receive an adequate and effective examination of his criminal conviction. (
<a target="_blank" href="https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=7154369965973865405&amp;q=35+Cal.+App.+5th+1027&amp;hl=en&amp;as_sdt=2006">

<p>
 I, for one, do not believe the imposition of the two assessments and one restitution fine on the defendant in
 <i>
  Dueñas
 </i>
 is an issue of access to our courts or justice system, as was the case in
 <i>
  Griffin
 </i>
 and similar authorities.
 <sup>
  <a class="gsl_hash" href="#[16]" name="r[16]">
   [9]
  </a>
 </sup>
 Nor do I believe the fines or fees imposed on the defendant in
 <i>
  Dueñas
 </i>
 satisfied the traditional due process definition of a taking of life, liberty or property.
</p>
<p>
 Likewise,
 <i>
  Dueñas
 </i>
 's citations to multiple provisions of the Government Code do not support its conclusion that our "Legislature has recognized the deleterious impact of increased court fees on indigent people." (
 <a target="_blank" href="https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=13269025107103154166&amp;q=35+Cal.+App.+5th+1027&amp;hl=en&amp;as_sdt=2006">

 .) In my view, these statutes instead ensure that all people, without regard to economic status, have equal access to our justice system. Again, in my opinion the imposition of the two assessments and one restitution fine on the defendant in
 <i>
  Dueñas
 </i>
 was not an issue of
 <i>
  access
 </i>
 to the courts or our system of justice.
</p>
<p>
 In sum, I find no general due process and equal protection authority which
 <i>
  requires
 </i>
 a court to conduct a
 <i>
  preassessment present ability-to-pay
 </i>
 hearing before imposing any fine or fee on a defendant, as
 <i>
  Dueñas
 </i>
 seems to conclude. On a practical note, it takes little imagination to envision the potential expansion of the holding of
 <i>
  Dueñas
 </i>
 to a multitude of other fines or fees that were not the subject of that case, or the instant case. One such possible fine is victim restitution, which is encompassed in subdivision (f) of section 1202.4—one of the same statutes at issue in
 <i>
  Dueñas.
 </i>
 Although that subdivision expressly requires a court to order "full restitution" to the victim, should the constitutional basis of
 <i>
  Dueñas
 </i>
 stand, any restitution hearing might require a finding of
 <i>
  present ability
 </i>
 to pay victim restitution.

<p>
 Briefly, in

  Bajakajian

 the defendant attempted to take $357,144 out of the country, in contravention of federal law requiring any person transporting more than $10,000 out of the United States to file a report with the appropriate government agency. The government in
 <i>
  Bajakajian

 claimed that the entire $357,144 was forfeited. (

 Dueñas
</i>
's expansion of due process in a manner that grants criminal defendants a protection not conferred by either its foundational pillars a correct interpretation?
<p>
 In our view, it is not. We reach this conclusion for two reasons.
</p>
<p>
 First,
 <i>
  Dueñas
 </i>
 does more than go beyond its foundations; it announces a principle inconsistent with them. Our Supreme Court in
 <a target="_blank" href="https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=6927857349271520258&amp;q=40+Cal.+App.+5th+320&amp;hl=en&amp;as_sdt=2006">
  <i>
   Antazo, supra,
  </i>
  3 Cal.3d 100,
 </a>
 expressly declined to "hold that the imposition upon an indigent offender of a fine [or] penalty assessment, either as a sentence or as a condition of probation, constitutes of necessity in all instances a violation of the equal protection clause." (
 <i>
  Id.
 </i>
 at pp. 116, 103-104.)
 <i>
  Antazo
 </i>
 refused to prohibit the imposition of fines and assessments upon indigent defendants for good reason, which the United States Supreme Court explained best: "The State . . . has a fundamental interest in appropriately punishing persons—rich and poor—who violate its criminal laws," such that "[a] defendant's poverty in no way immunizes him from punishment." (
 <a target="_blank" href="https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=12397530380886309714&amp;q=40+Cal.+App.+5th+320&amp;hl=en&amp;as_sdt=2006">
  <i>
   Bearden, supra,
  </i>
  461 U.S. at pp. 669-670
 </a>
 .) To confer such an immunity, that court has said, "would amount to inverse discrimination [because] it would enable an indigent [defendant] to avoid both the fine and imprisonment for nonpayment whereas other defendants must always suffer one or the other . . . ." (
 <a target="_blank" href="https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=8107436400939860073&amp;q=40+Cal.+App.+5th+320&amp;hl=en&amp;as_sdt=2006">
  <i>
   Williams, supra,
  </i>
  399 U.S. at p. 244
 </a>
 .) By adopting an across-the-board prohibition on the very imposition of assessments and fines on indigent defendants,
 <i>
  Dueñas
 </i>
 prohibits a practice that
 <i>
  Antazo
 </i>
 sanctioned (albeit under a different constitutional provision). What is more,
 <i>
  Dueñas
 </i>
 mandates the very type of "inverse discrimination" condemned by the court in both
 <i>
  Bearden
 </i>
 and
 <i>
  Williams.
 </i>
</p>
<p>
 Second,
 <i>
  Dueñas
 </i>
 is inconsistent with the purposes and operation of probation. The chief purpose of probation is to "`rehabilitat[e]'" and "reintegrat[e]. . . [a] [defendant] into the community." (
 <a target="_blank" href="https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=2177565006552872163&amp;q=40+Cal.+App.+5th+320&amp;hl=en&amp;as_sdt=2006">

 </a>
 ; § 1202.7.) One way to achieve this purpose is to require the defendant-probationer to make an effort to repay his debt to society. This is why our Legislature has specifically empowered trial courts to "require[,] as a condition of probation[,] that [a] probationer go to work and earn money" in order "to pay any fine imposed or reparation condition." (§ 1203.1, subd. (d).) And it is why the constitutional prohibition against incarcerating a defendant for the inability to pay criminal penalties due solely to his indigence does not prohibit "revoking probation and using imprisonment as an appropriate penalty" when a probationer has "fail[ed] to make sufficient bona fide efforts to seek employment or borrow money in order to pay the fine or restitution."

  <i>

 <i>

 the trial was over and, except for the bare fact of their imposition, is not otherwise challenged on appeal.

<p>
 The second strand also does not dictate

 The purpose of victim restitution, on the other hand, is neither to raise funds nor to punish a defendant; it "is to reimburse the victim for economic losses caused by the defendant's criminal conduct, i.e., to make the victim reasonably whole." (

</p>
<p>
 Based on the significant differences in purpose and effect between victim restitution and the moneys at issue in

 we decline to extend the rule of

 to victim restitution. In a civil action for compensatory damages, a defendant's wealth is irrelevant to liability. (

 The prosecutor's objection at the hearing was thus sufficient to preserve for appeal the issue that the trial court erred in entering its order suspending, dismissing, or otherwise disposing of the restitution fine and, in any case, the claim may be characterized as a species of unauthorized sentence, as to which no objection was required.

  Legislative History: Victims' Bill of Rights
 </i>
</h4>
<p>
</p>
<p>
 (3) In June 1982, the electorate passed Proposition 8, known as "The Victims' Bill of Rights." Among other things, Proposition 8 declared a state constitutional right of crime victims to restitution from those persons convicted of crimes, which crimes caused losses to the victims. (Cal. Const., art. I, § 28, subd. (b)(13)(A).) In response to the new constitutional provisions, the Legislature amended some old statutes and enacted new ones to implement the right to restitution. (See
 <a target="_blank" href="https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=13825503652650525493&amp;q=214+Cal.+App.+4th+1438&amp;hl=en&amp;as_sdt=2006">

 </a>
 .)
</p>
<p>
 The statutes recognize two kinds of restitution: (1) restitution fines (Pen. Code, § 1202.4, subd. (b)), which are not directly related to the amount of loss sustained by a victim, and (2) direct restitution to the victim (Pen. Code, § 1202.4, subd. (f)), which is based on the amount of the loss the victim actually sustained. The purposes of the two kinds of restitution are different. The imposition of a restitution fine is punishment. (See
 <a target="_blank" href="https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=905941912314791309&amp;q=214+Cal.+App.+4th+1438&amp;hl=en&amp;as_sdt=2006">

  </i>

 .) The purpose of direct victim restitution, however, is to reimburse the victim for economic losses caused by the defendant's criminal conduct, i.e., to make the victim reasonably whole. (

'>THE PEOPLE, Plaintiff and Respondent,
v.
RICHARD ANTHONY EVANS, Defendant and Appellant. (page *778)</a></h4>We are not persuaded otherwise by the fact that in this case, the victims have already received compensation through the California Victim Compensation Board. As explained in
<i>
 Holman,
</i>
"[t]he Restitution Fund is in the State Treasury Department, and is used to compensate victims for certain kinds of `pecuniary losses they suffer as a direct result of criminal acts.' (Gov. Code, § 13950, subd. (a).) Crime victims may apply to the Restitution Fund as one avenue to recover monetary losses caused by criminal conduct." (
<a target="_blank" href="https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=4100774489987678212&amp;q=39+Cal.+App.+5th+771&amp;hl=en&amp;as_sdt=2006">
 <i>
  Holman, supra,
 </i>
 214 Cal.App.4th at p. 1452,
</a>
citing § 1202.4, subd. (f)(2).) Then, "when direct victim restitution has been satisfied by the victim's application to the victim compensation program, the amounts a defendant is ordered to pay as direct victim restitution are instead paid to the Restitution Fund." (
<i>
 Holman,
</i>
at p. 1452.) We see no reason that defendant should receive a windfall—and the Restitution Fund should suffer a loss—simply because the victims exercised their right to apply to the California Victim Compensation Board rather than waiting for the victim restitution order.

 Subsequent cases have suggested that the proper analytic framework for evaluating the constitutionality of punitive fines, such as restitution fines under section 1202.4, subdivision (b), is the excessive fines clause of the Eighth Amendment to the United States Constitution, rather than the due process clause.

 we want to make clear that it is Appellants' burden to make a record below as to their ability to pay these assessments. To the extent the
 <i>
  Dueñas
 </i>
 court implies that it is the prosecution's burden to prove that a defendant can pay an assessment (see
 <i>
  id.
 </i>
 at p. 1172), we disagree. It is the defendant who bears the burden of proving an inability to pay. (Cf.
 <a target="_blank" href="https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=13901479352093369925&amp;q=38+Cal.+App.+5th+47&amp;hl=en&amp;as_sdt=2006">

 .) In addition, the
 <i>
  Dueñas
 </i>
 court suggests that the trial court must evaluate a defendant's
 <i>
  present
 </i>
 ability to pay any fees or fines. (See
 <i>
  Dueñas,
 </i>
 at p. 1164.) The court, however, does not define what is meant by "present." To avoid confusion, we make clear that the trial court should not limit itself to considering only whether Appellants have the ability to pay at the time of the sentencing hearing. As both Appellants will be serving lengthy prison sentences, it is appropriate for the court to consider the wages that both may earn in prison. (See
 <a target="_blank" href="https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=14391975209538447773&amp;q=38+Cal.+App.+5th+47&amp;hl=en&amp;as_sdt=2006">

</p>
<p>
 Additionally, we do not follow the court's approach to restitution fines in
 <i>
  Dueñas.
 </i>
 There, the court acknowledged that the restitution fine under section 1202.4 is "additional punishment for a crime." (
 <a target="_blank" href="https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=13269025107103154166&amp;q=38+Cal.+App.+5th+47&amp;hl=en&amp;as_sdt=2006">
  <i>
   Dueñas, supra,
  </i>
  30 Cal.App.5th at p. 1169
 </a>
 .) Yet, the court still focused solely on a defendant's ability to pay in determining whether such a punitive fine is constitutional. To this end, the court held: "[A]lthough Penal Code section 1202.4 bars consideration of a defendant's ability to pay unless the judge is considering increasing the fee over the statutory minimum, the execution of any restitution fine imposed under this statute must be stayed unless and until the trial court holds an ability to pay hearing and concludes that the defendant has the present ability to pay the restitution fine." (

  <i>

 Instead, because these fines are intended to punish defendants, we agree with the People that a defendant should challenge such fines under the excessive fines clause of the Eighth Amendment of the federal Constitution and article I, section 17 of the California Constitution. Put differently, there is no due process requirement that the court hold an ability

<p>
 The Eighth Amendment to the United States Constitution states: "Excessive bail shall not be required, nor excessive fines imposed, nor cruel and unusual punishments inflicted." "[T]he Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment to the Federal Constitution ... makes the Eighth Amendment's prohibition against excessive fines and cruel and unusual punishments applicable to the States. [Citation.] The Due Process Clause of its own force also prohibits the States from imposing `grossly excessive' punishments...." (

 The California Constitution contains similar protections. Article I, section 17, prohibits "cruel or unusual punishment" and "excessive fines"; article I, section 7, prohibits the taking of property "without due process of law."

 </a>
 , which involved a federal statute (31 U.S.C. § 5316(a)) requiring any person transporting more than $10,000 out of the United States to file a report with the United States Customs Service. The defendant attempted to take $357,144 out of the country without filing a report. The government claimed that the entire $357,144 was forfeited. The high court pointed out that "[t]he touchstone of the constitutional inquiry under the Excessive Fines Clause is the principle of proportionality." (
 <i>
  Bajakajian,
 </i>
 at p. 334.) It then set out four considerations: (1) the defendant's culpability; (2) the relationship between the harm and the penalty; (3) the penalties imposed in similar statutes; and (4) the defendant's ability to pay. (
 <i>
  Id.

 at pp. 337-338.) After reviewing those considerations, the high court held that the forfeiture of the defendant's currency constituted an "excessive fine" barred by the Eighth Amendment.
</p>
<p>
 The California Supreme Court has adopted the same four factors to analyze whether a fine is constitutionally disproportionate. (See
 <a target="_blank" href="https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=16141801228317267644&amp;q=38+Cal.+App.+5th+47&amp;hl=en&amp;as_sdt=2006">

 Respondent's crime was solely a reporting offense. It was permissible to transport the currency out of the country so long as he reported it. Section 982(a)(1) orders currency to be forfeited for a "willful" violation of the reporting requirement. Thus, the essence of respondent's crime is a willful failure to report the removal of currency from the United States.

 DISPOSITION
</h4>
<p>
</p>
<p>
 Appellants' respective convictions under count 4 are reversed. We remand this matter to the superior court to hold an ability to pay hearing and resentence Appellants consistent with this opinion and amend the abstracts of judgment accordingly. As part of resentencing, Hernandez may move under Senate Bill No. 1393 (2017-2018 Reg. Sess.) to strike his prior serious felony conviction. In addition, Appellants may challenge their punitive fines under the California and federal constitutions as set forth in this opinion. We offer no opinion regarding how the superior court should rule on these matters. In all other respects, the judgment is affirmed.

 I agree with the majority that, despite defendant Christi J. Kopp's failure at sentencing to object on the ground of inability to pay the various fines and assessments imposed by the trial court, her claim of error has been preserved on appeal as a result of the inability-to-pay objection made by codefendant Jason Samuel Hernandez.

 "There is good reason to be concerned that fines, uniquely of all punishments, will be imposed in a measure out of accord with the penal goals of retribution and deterrence....

 While we do not join the courts that have declared
 <i>
  Dueñas
 </i>
 to have been wrongly decided, we do agree with an insight put forward in some of the opinions taking that position. A suitable framework for analyzing the constitutionality of the restitution fine imposed here, as well as the assessments, in our view, is the excessive fines prohibition in the Eighth Amendment and its counterpart under the California Constitution, article I, section 17. (E.g.,

 The Restitution Fine and the Assessments All Qualify as "Fines" for Purposes of the Eighth Amendment and Article I, Section 17 of the California Constitution
</i>
<p>
</p>
<p>
 Underlying the Attorney General's position on Cowan's ability-to-pay objection is the implicit premise that the restitution fine is subject to scrutiny as an Eighth Amendment "fine," while the assessments are nonpunitive and therefore do not fall within the ambit of federal or state constitutional prohibitions on excessive fines. We do not agree with that premise. Taking the analysis a step further than that of the

 </i>
 majority or Justice Benke in her separate opinions in
 <i>
  Gutierrez

 <i>
  Kopp,

 we believe that all of the monetary exactions at issue here must be treated as punitive in nature and thus may be analyzed as "fines" for purposes of the Eighth Amendment and article I, section 17 of the California Constitution. (

<p>
 If we were to apply this two-step
 <i>
  Ward/Mendoza-Martinez
 </i>
 analytical paradigm, the Attorney General's bifurcated analysis of the restitution fine and the assessments might be warranted. Because the charge imposed under Penal Code section 1202.4 is denominated a "fine" and is levied only on convicted criminals, there would be no need to go beyond the face of the statute to justify the conclusion that the Legislature intended restitution fines to be punitive in nature.
 <sup>
  <a class="gsl_hash" href="#[14]" name="r[14]">
   [13]
  </a>
 </sup>
 By contrast for the assessments, the phrases "court operations assessment" and "court facilities assessment" signal an intent to raise revenue for the courts, and the legislative history confirms that objective.
 <sup>
  <a class="gsl_hash" href="#[15]" name="r[15]">
   [14]
  </a>

 Even granting that there may be some ambiguity because the assessments are imposed only on criminal convictions, we cannot say by "`"the clearest proof" that "the [assessments are] so punitive either in purpose or effect as to negate [the Legislature's] intention" to deem [them] "civil."'" (

 But a different approach is called for in the context of excessive fines. The Eighth Amendment's "protection against excessive fines guards against abuses of government's punitive or criminal-law-enforcement authority," and applies to civil and criminal penalties alike. (

 Finally, we must reject the contention that the proportionality of full forfeiture is demonstrated by the fact that the First Congress enacted statutes requiring full forfeiture of goods involved in customs offenses or the payment of monetary penalties proportioned to the goods' value. It is argued that the enactment of these statutes at roughly the same time that the Eighth Amendment was ratified suggests that full forfeiture, in the customs context at least, is a proportional punishment. The early customs statutes, however, do not support such a conclusion because, unlike § 982(a)(1), the type of forfeiture that they imposed was not considered punishment for a criminal offense.
</p>
<p>
 Certain of the early customs statutes required the forfeiture of goods imported in violation of the customs laws, and, in some instances, the vessels carrying them as well. See
 <i>
  , e. g.,
 </i>
 Act of Aug. 4, 1790, § 27, 1 Stat. 163 (goods unladen without a permit from the collector). These forfeitures, however, were civil

 forfeitures, in which the Government proceeded against the property itself on the theory that it was guilty, not against a criminal defendant. See,

 It is apparent from
 <i>
  Lockyer
 </i>
 that California courts, borrowing from a line of federal circuit cases, have adopted a broad reading of
 <i>
  Bajakajian
 </i>
 in which ability to pay must be taken into account as a factor bearing on proportionality. "The critical question is whether a defendant's ability to pay is appropriately considered in determining whether there are constitutional limitations on the amounts of fines and fees imposed. If it is, [Cowan] should be afforded a hearing at which he can attempt to make his case." (
 <a target="_blank" href="https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=17164281736574169402&amp;q=47+Cal.+App.+5th+32&amp;hl=en&amp;as_sdt=2006">

   Cota, supra,
  </i>
  45 Cal.App.5th at p. 799
 </a>
 (conc. &amp; dis. opn. of Dato, J.).) We think it is. Because ability to pay is an element of the excessive fines calculus under both the federal and state Constitutions, we conclude that a sentencing court may not impose court operations or facilities assessments or restitution fines without giving the defendant, on request, an opportunity to present evidence and argument why such monetary exactions exceed his ability to pay.

 "Ordinarily a reviewing court, having examined the relevant considerations, can decide for itself whether a fine or penalty is unconstitutionally excessive" (

 ), but where a defendant's excessive fine objection raises factual questions, a remand is required so that the trial court can make the necessary findings as a predicate to the excessiveness determination and weigh the relevant factors in the first instance. (

 Our reading of § 523(a)(7) differs from that of the Second Circuit. On its face, it creates a broad exception for all penal sanctions, whether they be denominated fines, penalties, or forfeitures. Congress included two qualifying phrases; the fines must be both "to and for the benefit of a governmental unit," and "not compensation for actual pecuniary loss." Section 523(a)(7) protects traditional criminal fines; it codifies the judicially created exception to discharge for fines. We must decide whether the result is altered by the two major differences between restitution and a traditional fine. Unlike

 In applying section 523(a)(7) to restitution orders in criminal judgments, the Supreme Court stated: "The criminal justice system is not operated primarily for the benefit of victims, but for the benefit of society as a whole. Thus, it is concerned not only with punishing the offender, but also with rehabilitating him. Although restitution does resemble a judgment `for the benefit of' the victim, the context in which it is imposed undermines that conclusion. The victim has no control over the amount of restitution awarded or over the decision to award restitution. Moreover, the decision to impose restitution generally does not turn on the victim's injury, but on the penal goals of the State and the situation of the defendant.... [¶] ... [¶] Because criminal proceedings focus on the State's interests in rehabilitation and punishment, rather than the victim's desire for compensation, we conclude that restitution orders imposed in such proceedings operate `for the benefit of' the State. Similarly, they are not assessed `for ... compensation' of the victim. The sentence following a criminal conviction necessarily considers the penal and rehabilitative interests of the State. Those interests are sufficient to place restitution orders within the meaning of § 523(a)(7)." (

<p>
 Formerly, both restitution fines and direct victim restitution were limited to a maximum imposition of $10,000. (See Gov. Code, former § 13967, subd. (c); Pen. Code, § 1202.4, former subd. (b).) Now, however, the victim (direct) restitution statute requires the trial court to order full restitution, in the amount of the losses resulting from the defendant's criminal acts, unless the court finds clear and compelling reasons for not doing so, and states these reasons on the record. (Pen. Code, § 1202.4, subds. (f), (g).)
 <sup>
  <a class="gsl_hash" href="#[3]" name="r[3]">
   [3]
  </a>
 </sup>
</p>
<p>
 (4) The restitution fines are not paid directly to the victims of crime. Rather, they are deposited to the Restitution Fund. (Pen. Code, § 1202.4, subd. (e).) The Restitution Fund is in the State Treasury Department, and is used to compensate victims for certain kinds of "pecuniary losses they suffer as a direct result of criminal acts." (Gov. Code, § 13950, subd. (a).) Crime victims may apply to the Restitution Fund as one avenue to recover monetary losses caused by criminal conduct. "If the victim has received assistance from the Victim Compensation Program under Govt.C. 13950 et seq., restitution to the victim is also paid to the Restitution Fund. (P.C. 1202.4(f)(2).)" (3 Witkin &amp; Epstein, Cal. Criminal Law (4th ed. 2012) Punishment, § 110, p. 194.) Thus, when direct victim restitution has been satisfied by the victim's application to the victim compensation program, the amounts a defendant is ordered to pay as direct victim restitution are instead paid to the Restitution Fund. "[T]o the extent that the victim has received assistance from the Restitution Fund under Govt.C. 13950 et seq...., payment must be made to the fund. (P.C. 1202.4(f)(2).)" (3 Witkin &amp; Epstein,
 <i>
  supra,
 </i>
 Cal. Criminal Law, Punishment, § 117, p. 204.) Penal Code section 1202.4, subdivision (j), includes a reciprocal provision, to the effect that "[t]he making of a restitution order pursuant to subdivision (f) shall not affect the right of a victim to recovery from the Restitution Fund as otherwise provided by law, except to the extent that restitution is actually collected pursuant to the order." Thus, direct victim restitution payments, which the victim actually collects from the defendant, are offset from the victim's eligibility to recover from the Restitution Fund.

 An order for direct victim restitution does not preclude a separate civil action by the victim. Penal Code section 1202.4, subdivision (j), also

It is larger than the $5,000 fine imposed by the District Court by many orders of magnitude, and it bears no articulable correlation to any injury suffered by the Government.

 Finally, we must reject the contention that the proportionality of full forfeiture is demonstrated by the fact that the First Congress enacted statutes requiring full forfeiture of goods involved in customs offenses or the payment of monetary penalties proportioned to the goods' value. It is argued that the enactment of these statutes at roughly the same time that the Eighth Amendment was ratified suggests that full forfeiture, in the customs context at least, is a proportional punishment. The early customs statutes, however, do not support such a conclusion because, unlike § 982(a)(1), the type of forfeiture that they imposed was not considered punishment for a criminal offense.

<p>
 Certain of the early customs statutes required the forfeiture of goods imported in violation of the customs laws, and, in some instances, the vessels carrying them as well. See
 <i>
  , e. g.,
 </i>
 Act of Aug. 4, 1790, § 27, 1 Stat. 163 (goods unladen without a permit from the collector). These forfeitures, however, were civil
 <i>
  in rem
 </i>
 forfeitures, in which the Government proceeded against the property itself on the theory that it was guilty, not against a criminal defendant. See,
 <i>
  e. g.,
 </i>

 (same). Such forfeitures sought to vindicate the Government's underlying property right in customs duties, and like other traditional
 <i>

 forfeitures, they were not considered at the founding to be punishment for an offense. See
