 We think that this doctrine has an obvious application by analogy to cases in which an officer discovers contraband through the sense of touch during an otherwise lawful search. The rationale of the plain-view doctrine is that if contraband is left in open view and is observed by a police officer from a lawful vantage point, there has been no invasion of a legitimate expectation of privacy and thus no "search" within the meaning of the Fourth Amendment — or at least no search independent of the initial intrusion that gave the officers their vantage point.

"In an age where private and commercial flight in the public airways is routine, it is unreasonable for respondent to expect that his marijuana plants were constitutionally protected from being observed with the naked eye from an altitude of 1,000 feet.

 We arrive at the same conclusion in the present case. In this case, as in

 the property surveyed was within the curtilage of respondent's home. Riley no doubt intended and expected that his greenhouse would not be open to public inspection, and the precautions he took protected against ground-level observation.

v.
MARYLAND. (page *743)</a></h4>subscribers, on a page entitled "Consumer Information," that the company "can frequently help in identifying to the authorities the origin of unwelcome and troublesome calls."
<i>
 E. g.,
</i>
Baltimore Telephone Directory 21 (1978); District of Columbia Telephone Directory 13 (1978). Telephone users, in sum, typically know that they must convey numerical information to the phone company; that the phone company has facilities for recording this information; and that the phone company does in fact record this information for a variety of legitimate business purposes. Although subjective expectations cannot be scientifically gauged, it is too much to believe that telephone subscribers, under these circumstances, harbor any general expectation that the numbers they dial will remain secret.
<p>
 Petitioner argues, however, that, whatever the expectations of telephone users in general, he demonstrated an expectation of privacy by his own conduct here, since he "us[ed] the telephone
 <i>
  in his house
 </i>
 to the exclusion of all others." Brief for Petitioner 6 (emphasis added). But the site of the call is immaterial for purposes of analysis in this case. Although petitioner's conduct may have been calculated to keep the
 <i>
  contents
 </i>
 of his conversation private, his conduct was not and could not have been calculated to preserve the privacy of the number he dialed. Regardless of his location, petitioner had to convey that number to the telephone company in precisely the same way if he wished to complete his call. The fact that he dialed the number on his home phone rather than on some other phone could make no conceivable difference, nor could any subscriber rationally think that it would.
</p>
<p>
 Second, even if petitioner did harbor some subjective expectation that the phone numbers he dialed would remain private, this expectation is not "one that society is prepared to recognize as 'reasonable.'"

 <i>

 or leverages the technology of a wireless carrier, we hold that an individual maintains a legitimate expectation of privacy in the record of his physical movements as captured through CSLI. The location information obtained from Carpenter's wireless carriers was the product of a search.

 Allowing government access to cell-site records contravenes that expectation. Although such records are generated for commercial purposes, that distinction does not negate Carpenter's anticipation of privacy in his physical location. Mapping a cell phone's location over the course of 127 days provides an all-encompassing record of the holder's whereabouts. As with GPS information, the time-stamped data provides an intimate window into a person's life, revealing not only his particular movements, but through them his "familial, political, professional, religious, and sexual associations."

'>UNITED STATES of America, Plaintiff-Appellant,
v.
Howard Wesley COTTERMAN, Defendant-Appellee. (page *962)</a></h4>surrounding identification of a "functional" border. As to the extended border search doctrine, we believe it is best confined to cases in which, after an apparent border crossing or functional entry, an attenuation in the time or the location of conducting a search reflects that the subject has regained an expectation of privacy.

<p>
 In his dissent, Judge Smith advocates applying the extended border search doctrine because the forensic examination occurred 170 miles from the border and days after Cotterman's entry. Moving the laptop to a specialized lab at a distant location might highlight that the search undertaken there was an extensive one, but it is not the dispositive factor here. Because Cotterman never regained possession of his laptop, the fact that the forensic examination occurred away from the border, in Tucson, did not heighten the interference with his privacy. Time and distance become relevant to determining whether there is an adequate nexus to a recent border crossing only after the subject or items searched have entered.

 B. Forensic Examination At The Border Requires Reasonable Suspicion

 It is the comprehensive and intrusive nature of a forensic examination — not the location of the examination — that is the key factor triggering the requirement of reasonable suspicion here.

To carry out the examination of Cotterman's laptop, Agent Owen used computer forensic software to copy the hard drive and then analyze it in its entirety, including data that ostensibly had been deleted.

 While we acknowledge that the physical cell phone in this case was left in the stolen vehicle by the individual, and it was not claimed by anyone at the police station, its contents were still protected by a password, clearly indicating an intention to protect the privacy of all of the digital material on the cell phone or able to be accessed by it. Indeed, the password protection that most cell phone users place on their devices is designed specifically to prevent unauthorized access to the vast store of personal information which a cell phone can hold when the phone is out of the owner's possession.
</p>
<p>
 In light of
 <i>
  Riley,
 </i>
 the United States Supreme Court treats cell phones differently, for the purposes of privacy protection, than other physical objects. Although
 <i>
  Riley
 </i>
 conceded that some "case-specific" exceptions may apply to justify a warrantless search of a cell phone, the example given was a search based upon exigent circumstances.
 <a target="_blank" href="https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=9647156672357738355&amp;q=207+So.+3d+951&amp;hl=en&amp;as_sdt=2006">

 . "Such exigencies could include the need to prevent the imminent destruction of evidence in individual cases, to pursue a fleeing suspect, and to assist persons who are seriously injured or are threatened with imminent injury."
 <i>
  Id.
 </i>
 The abandonment exception does not compel a similar conclusion that a warrantless search is authorized. There is no danger to individuals, property, or the need to immediately capture a criminal suspect where the cell phone is out of the custody of the suspect for substantial amounts of time. And there is an abundant amount of time for the police to obtain a warrant, which could then limit, if necessary, the scope of the search of the phone.

<p>
 <i>
  Riley

 also acknowledged the argument that requiring a warrant to search an arrestee's phone may pose some impediment to law enforcement, but it rejected that contention in light of the important privacy interests involved and the relative ease with which a search warrant may be obtained:

v.
Dontae SMALL, Defendant-Appellant. (page *503)</a></h4>"abandonments." Rather, as the district court noted, "[t]here has to be some voluntary aspect to the circumstances that lead to the phone being what could be called abandoned." J.A. 41. Here there clearly was.
<p>
 The evidence before the district court depicts a fleeing suspect tossing aside personal items while attempting to evade capture. Small fled on foot after crashing through the NSA gates, leaving his vehicle and its contents behind. Search personnel would continue to find Small's personal items strewn about during the manhunt. At 1:45 am, officers located a bloody shirt and hat in the vicinity of the crashed car. The obvious conclusion is that these items—or, at the very least, the shirt— were purposefully removed and tossed aside. Several hours later, around 5:00 am, officers located a cell phone only fifty yards from the shirt and hat. The phone was found in a grassy area, not on a sidewalk or "a place where [someone] normally might be." J.A. 43.
</p>
<p>
 Based on these circumstances, the district court's inference that Small abandoned the phone seems sensible. Because a cell phone's GPS tracking can "lead you to a defendant," J.A. 39, it is credible that a fleeing suspect might intentionally discard his phone. And while phones occasionally slip out of pockets, shirts do not accidentally fall off their wearers—at the exact same moments as hats—and cars do not ditch themselves after a crash. The fleeing suspect's relinquishment of the car, the hat, and the shirt near where the cell phone was found support the district court's finding of abandonment.
</p>
<p>
 The district court relied heavily on these circumstances to reach its conclusion that Small no longer had a "reasonable expectation of privacy in th[e] phone." J.A. 42-43. Small "is fleeing from the police, he crashes through a gate in a place where he is not supposed to be. He's clearly left the car. Items are being left behind, the bloody shirt and hat being one of them." J.A. 42. Further, the court noted that there was no evidence Small attempted to retrieve his phone at any point, even though it wasn't password protected.

</p>
<p>
 Evidence gleaned from trial testimony points in the same direction. This testimony demonstrates why search personnel could reasonably conclude at the time of the search that the phone belonged to the suspect-at-large. While the government briefly noted at the suppression hearing that the NSA went on "lockdown" when Small crashed through the fence, J.A. 27, trial testimony from several search personnel gave a more complete picture of the scope of the manhunt. The testimony suggests that few people besides the suspect and search personnel were out-and-about in the hours before the phone was found.
</p>
<p>
 As trial testimony established, the cell phone was found in a large crime scene, not in a crowded public area. An Anne Arundel police officer radioed during the car chase for "aviation assets" and "K-9 assets." J.A. 74. After Small entered Fort Meade but before he crashed through the NSA fence, an Army sergeant locked the Fort Meade gates and only reopened them to allow entry by search personnel. After

 Crumble urges this Court to categorically deny application of the abandonment doctrine to cell phones. We decline to do so. Crumble points to Riley v.

However, Riley's holding is limited to cell phones seized incident to arrest. Id. at 2495. Riley was explicit that "other case-specific exceptions may still justify a warrantless search of a particular phone." Id. at 2494. Other courts have found abandonment to be one such exception. See, e.g.,

 We conclude the district court did not clearly err in finding abandonment and denying Crumble's motion to suppress. Because we affirm the district court's holding based on abandonment, we need not consider whether the warrant was valid. Cf.

 We next turn to Crumble's sentencing challenge. The district court sentenced Crumble to the ACCA mandatory minimum of 15 years imprisonment. The ACCA applies when a defendant convicted under 18 U.S.C. § 922(g) has three prior convictions "for a violent felony or a serious drug offense." 18 U.S.C. § 924(e)(1). As noted earlier, Crumble's prior felony convictions include a Minnesota conviction for second-degree assault, a Minnesota conviction for second-degree burglary, and two Minnesota convictions for third-degree burglary. Crumble argues his burglary convictions do not qualify as violent felonies under the ACCA, and the government agrees. We review whether a prior conviction qualifies as a violent felony de novo.

 ¶ 25 Neither

 can be read for the proposition that the abandonment doctrine should not apply to cell phones or should be limited in its application to cell phones. The

 <i>
  Hinton
 </i>
 was predicated on the fact that revealing some information in one's cell phone to third parties as a means of modern communication has become a common practice. But in this case and for the abandonment doctrine, there has been no advancement in technology to cause one to abandon property in stolen vehicles while attempting to flee from police. Moreover, the rationale driving the abandonment doctrine fits cell phone searches.

 When an individual voluntarily abandons an item, not as a facet of modern communication but to elude the police, that individual voluntarily exposes that item — and all information that it may contain — to anyone who may come across it. Cell phones are no different in this respect than for any other item; the abandonment doctrine applies to all personal property equally.

 . In this case, the trial court's finding that Samalia abandoned his cell phone is supported by substantial evidence and our case law.

 ¶ 28 The trial court's finding that Samalia voluntarily abandoned his cell phone reasonably follows from the undisputed facts of the case: Samalia was driving a stolen vehicle, and when Samalia stopped, he got out of the vehicle and faced Officer Yates. Then, instead of obeying Officer Yates' commands, Samalia ran away, abandoning the vehicle and its contents. Officer Yates attempted to catch Samalia, but Samalia escaped, and Officer Yates returned to the stolen vehicle. Inside the stolen vehicle, Officer Yates found the cell phone. Indeed, there is nothing in the record to suggest that Samalia protected the information on his cell phone by any security measures.

 ¶ 29 The trial court's finding of voluntary abandonment is also consistent with Washington case law, further demonstrating that its finding is supported by substantial evidence. Washington courts generally find voluntary abandonment when a defendant leaves an item in a place in which the defendant has no privacy interest as an attempt to evade the police. For example, in
